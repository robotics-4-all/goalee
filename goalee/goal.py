        Runs the goal until it reaches a terminal state (COMPLETED or FAILED) or exceeds the maximum duration.

        This method repeatedly calls the `tick` method to progress the goal's state. It checks the elapsed time
        to determine if the goal has exceeded its maximum allowed duration, in which case it sets the state to FAILED.
        If the goal completes or fails, it calls the `on_exit` method.

        The method also ensures that the goal runs for at least the minimum duration specified. If the goal completes
        before the minimum duration, it sets the state to FAILED.

        Attributes:
            ts_start (float): The timestamp when the method starts running.
            elapsed (float): The time elapsed since the method started running.

        Raises:
            None

        Notes:
            - The method sleeps for a duration determined by the frequency (`self._freq`) between each tick.
            - The goal's state is checked against `GoalState.COMPLETED` and `GoalState.FAILED` to determine if it should exit.
            - If `_max_duration` is None or 0, the goal can run indefinitely until it reaches a terminal state.
            - If `_min_duration` is None or 0, there is no minimum duration constraint for the goal.
